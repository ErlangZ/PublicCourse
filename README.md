# Public course from pony.ai
In this course you'll learn basic knowledge about autonomous car and complete essential algorithms
in autonomous car simulation system. In next weeks, you'll get some real data recorded during
our road test. Your task is writing code to recognise around obstacles, plan a best path to
avoid them and make autonomous car run along the road for its destination.

You can access the code and document for homework here.

Let's begin now!!!
